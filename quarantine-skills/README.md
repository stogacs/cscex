# Quarantine Skills

You're stuck in your house, and with all the free time you have, you're
thinking of developing some new skills. Because Time and Energy are
limited, you're trying to level up these skills with limited resources.

The two skills you're looking to develop are renaissance art history and
esoteric programming languages. They each take a specific amount of
Effort and require a specific number of hours of work (Time) per level.
You want to make sure to use exactly all the Time and Effort you have
available each day, in order to not waste any resources.

Your task is to determine how much of each skill you should work for,
given the exact number of units of Time and Effort you have.

That is, for the first parameter `art_req`, you will have two integers
separated by a space in a string, representing the amount of Time and
Effort, respectively, necessary to level up your renaissance art history
by 1.

Similarly, the second parameter `epl_req` will be two integers separated
by a space in a string representing the amount of Time and Effort,
respectively, necessary to level up your esoteric programming language
skills by 1.

Finally, the third parameter `to_spend` will have two integers separated
by a space in a string representing the amount of Time and Effort you
should use.

You need to output the levels you should gain for renaissance art
history and esoteric programming languages, respectively, as two
integers separated by a space in a string.

At maximum, one distinct integer solution will be possible. If no
non-negative integer outputs are possible, output `"-1 -1"` to indicate
that there is no solution.

You can assume that the inputs are non-negative integers.
