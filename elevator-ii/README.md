# Elevator II

Pear Inc.Â is slowly reopening their offices after months of having
employees work from home. At their giant skyscraper in the city, the
developers work on all different floors. Because CEO Tim Crook thinks
he's something of a futuristic visionary, the building only has
elevators. This is probably illegal, but it's Pear Inc.

The elevator itself can move up or down. When it reaches a floor where
someone has pressed the button to enter or leave the elevator, the
elevator will automatically open. Those who are leaving will first do
so, and then those who wish to get on will do so. If someone wishes to
enter the elevator when it is at full capacity, they cannot and the
elevator will close its doors.

Following months of disuse, the main elevator has fallen into a state of
slight disrepair. Thus, it can only handle a total weight of 1500
kilograms.

Because some social distancing measures are still in place, the
elevator, with a floor area of 9.1 square meters, can only fit a maximum
of 5 individuals at any given time.

At the busy lunch hour, `n` employees are waiting at the elevator door
on their respective floors. An employee starts on floor `s` and wishes
to go to floor `d`. The building has a total of `m` floors.

Try to write an algorithm that will transport all the employees to their
desired destination with the fewest number of movements up and down.
