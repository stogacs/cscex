# Elevator

For those who know and would rather use Python, use the `Python`
implementation, found in `python/`.

For those who know and would rather use Java, use the `Java`
implementation, found in `java/`. Starter code for students can be found
in `java-starter/`. This version does not require Maven.

## Goal

The objective is to implement the `Building::run` method to properly run
the elevator in the most efficient way possible.

More detailed instructions can be found in the `ElevatorTest` class in
`java-starter/`.
